# App for checking the APOD
This app lets you check the Astronomy Picute of the Day. It is my first project.
It communicates with NASA's open API to get the APOD so you can check it.
It is my first so there are some problems I have yet to figure out like being able to change
the text in the box, also it does not clear text if you try to get a different APOD

note- because this is an exe file your computer may warn about it being potentailly dangerous, but its just my little application.
